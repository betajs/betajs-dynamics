## Dynamics

Dynamics are at the very core of this Framework.
They are View Components that have been transformed into objects
and offer many ways of dealing with objects inherited from the BetaJS Core Framework
as well as functionality specific to the view.




## Handlebars

Handlebars are a way to do one of two things:
- Evaluate simple expressions
- Put Strings(Text) from the Javascipt into the DOM at the relevant parts


```html

    <div class="{{some_class}}">Hello</div>

```


## Partials

Partials are a form of pseudocode that allow you to write often used functions
directly into the DOM/view.

```html

    <div ba-if="">Hello</div>

```
