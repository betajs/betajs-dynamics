#### Dynamics

Dynamics are at the very core of this framework, representing its view components.




#### Handlebars

Handlebars are a way to do one of two things:
- Evaluate simple JavaScript expressions
- Put variables (text) from the Javascipt dynamic into the DOM at the relevant places


```html

    <div class="{{some_class}}">Hello</div>

```


#### Partials

Partials are a form of pseudocode that allow you to attach particular behaviour to nodes in the DOM/view.

```html

    <div ba-if="">Hello</div>

```
